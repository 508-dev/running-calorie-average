# 🥗 Running Calorie Average Tracker

A simple, elegant web application for tracking daily calorie intake with rolling averages. Built as a collaborative learning project by the [508.dev](https://508.dev) software engineering co-op.

## 🎯 What It Does

Track your daily calorie intake and view intelligent rolling averages (3-day, 5-day, 2-week, and monthly) that help smooth out daily fluctuations. Perfect for flexible calorie management without strict daily limits.

**Example**: If you consumed 1000, 1000, and 2000 calories over the last 3 days, your 3-day average would be 1333 calories/day. This approach allows for natural variation - like enjoying a holiday meal while maintaining overall balance.

## ✨ Features

- 📅 **Interactive Calendar View** - Visual month-at-a-glance with calorie data
- 🎛️ **Date Picker Integration** - Quick navigation to any date
- 📊 **Multiple Rolling Averages** - 3-day, 5-day, 2-week, and monthly views
- 📱 **Mobile-Friendly** - Swipe gestures for date navigation
- 💾 **Local Storage** - Your data stays private on your device
- 🔄 **Data Import/Export** - Backup and restore your calorie history
- 🎨 **Clean UI** - Modern, intuitive interface built with SvelteKit
